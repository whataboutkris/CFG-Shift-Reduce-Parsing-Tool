# CPSC-323-CFG Reduce Parsing Tool 
  This repository contains an implementation for a program that parses context-free grammar (CFG) using a parsing table. The CFG describes expressions over a set of terminals { id, +, *, ), ( } and ending with a dollar sign ($). The parsing table is a data structure that guides the parser on how to perform parsing actions based on the current state of the parsing process and the input symbols.

# How to Use:

  We have used the online collaborative IDE Replit to construct our "parser". If you would like to run it online without having to figure out the download, go to this link: https://replit.com/@kristianlosenar/CPSC-323-CFG-Shift-Reduce-Parsing-Tool-Project and sign in with either Google or Github. Once signed in, you can "fork and run" the code, in which you'll be able to run it from the website.

  If you want to run this in your own IDE, make sure you setup an environment with the following files: main.cpp. From there you can follow the code run below. 

# CODE RUN:
When using the code, write any input when it prompts you after running the code at the top. The program will output and will show you if its accepted/not accepted, and the stack. 


# Dependencies:
C++ Standard Library
